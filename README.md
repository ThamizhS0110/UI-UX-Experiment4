## Algorithm

1. **Welcome/Splash Screen:**  
   The initial screen featuring the brand logo/image and a "Get Started" button for users.

2. **Login/Signup Screen:**  
   Allows users to either log in with credentials or sign up for a new account.

3. **Home/Dashboard Screen:**  
   Displays the main navigation with options, search bar, and highlights (restaurants/products/etc.).

4. **Product Listing & Checkout/Final Action Screens:**  
   Shows items/products/dishes with an "Add to Cart" option, followed by a checkout screen where users can review their order and enter personal details before confirming the order.

## Output
<img width="1248" height="832" alt="5718f645-d1b9-4b10-930e-38aa4684f754" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79c31b33-1e3e-40f6-b2d7-433f8797eb08" />

Colorful wireframe images representing each stage of the app:
- Welcome/Splash
- Login/Signup
- Home/Dashboard
- Content/Product Listing
- Checkout/Contact/Final Action

These screens collectively visualize a user-friendly journey from launching the app, signing in, exploring options, selecting products, and completing a purchase.

## Result
A complete wireframe diagram, following best UI/UX practices, is created for a generic application. The illustrated flow ensures easy navigation, clear actions, and positive user experience across all main steps.
